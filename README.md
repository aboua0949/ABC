Assignment 3 Question 1 - 5 ICS3U Sem 1 2019-20

1. I/O Question: Find a data set you are interested in. (If stuck,
go to Environment Canada or U of W weather stats and
download something.) The data set must have at least 100
rows and 10 columns. Create a flowchart, then write a program
that reads in your txt or csv file and writes out a summary file
containing averages &amp;/or max and min values for the data set
and whatever other total information is relevant.
2. Take your dataset from question 1 and sort it using each of the sorts from class.
Record the length of time each sort took and display that to the screen
comparing the types of sort. Create an IPO chart and trace table for this
question. {Hint: time in milliseconds, before you run the search and after.}
3. Your task, Create a flowchart and IPO chart, then write a program to create the
game of 31 or UNO. Create a trace table on one of your errors. You will be using
at least one card class and some basic graphics in PyGame. Don’t forget
instructions. Instructions: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/thirty-one/

OR
(Easy option with highest possible mark 3- for a
matching game)
 In this option you will create a flowchart, and IPO
chart, and a trace table of one of your errors for a
basic matching game.  Consider that Hearts and
Diamonds match (red) and Spades and Clubs match (Black).  You must use at
least a 5 x 5 set of cards and the entire deck is at your disposal.  You will need
complete instructions for your user.

4. Create something recursive. Create a flowchart and IPO chart, very clearly
identify your base case. You may not use the Koch snowflake, or the Tower of
Hanoi. If you are stuck I suggest a palindrome checker.

5. WOW me with your Pygame Sprite knowledge. You may
use one I gave you in class or create your own. Have fun
with this one!

(A level 3+ would not leave the screen. What happens at screen edges determines how
much above a level 3+ you are…)
